## Organization Foundation

### Mission & Core Principles

**Mission:** Foster Greatness is a lived experience-led nonprofit platform creating lifelong community and belonging for current and former foster youth nationwide.

**Core Principle:** "Age into but never age out" - providing comprehensive support that evolves with members throughout their lives.

**The "Why":** We believe every foster youth deserves not just a job, housing, or an education, but a lifelong community—and we built a business to make that possible.

### What Makes Foster Greatness Different

1. **Not traditional charity** - A movement where belonging fuels transformation
2. **Lived experience leadership** - Built for foster youth, by foster youth
3. **Business-powered model** - Sustainable funding through DGW Branded partnership
4. **Community ownership** - Members shape programs and direction
5. **Dignity-centered approach** - Resources positioned as earned, not given

### The DGW Branded Connection

**Critical Context:** DGW Branded (Doing Good Works) is the social enterprise and promotional products company that powers Foster Greatness through direct business revenue. This business-powered nonprofit model is revolutionary and should be highlighted in partner communications.

**Key Message:** "Transform your routine business purchases into life-changing impact. Every promotional product order directly funds scholarships, crisis support, and career development for foster youth."

**The Origin Story:**
Co-founders Scott Henderson and Jordan Bartlett entered the foster care space with a workforce development mission in 2015. As they built relationships, they uncovered a deeper truth: foster youth lacked something far more fundamental than jobs, housing, or education—they lacked **a place to belong**. They lacked **lifelong community**. This revelation led to the creation of DGW Branded and Foster Greatness as two sides of the same mission: business as a force for good.

## Brand Voice & Messaging Framework

### Core Voice Attributes

1. **Authentic** - Real stories from real experiences, never performative
2. **Empowering** - Strengths-based language focusing on resilience and potential
3. **Conversational** - Warm and accessible, avoiding institutional jargon
4. **Inclusive** - Welcoming to all backgrounds within foster care experience
5. **Professional yet Personal** - Credible but never cold or distant

### Language Rules

#### ALWAYS Use:
- "Foster youth" and "former foster youth" or "foster alumni"
- "Community member" instead of "beneficiary" or "client"
- "Get the support you deserve" instead of charity language
- "Your earned benefits" instead of "assistance"
- Person-first language throughout
- Active voice and empowering verbs
- Specific program names and concrete outcomes

#### NEVER Use:
- Deficit-based terms: "at-risk," "vulnerable," "disadvantaged"
- "Aged out" as a defining characteristic
- "Broken system" narratives
- Charity/pity language ("help the less fortunate")
- Institutional service provider terminology
- Passive voice that removes agency
- Generic "support services" without specificity

### Messaging Hierarchy

Every piece of content should follow this flow:

1. **Community and belonging first** - Lead with connection
2. **Specific program benefits** - Concrete value proposition
3. **Impact and outcomes** - Evidence of transformation
4. **Call to action** - Clear next steps for engagement

## Content Creation Strategies

### Storytelling Best Practices

**When Sharing Member Stories:**
1. **Always obtain explicit consent** and written release
2. **Center their agency** - they're the protagonist
3. **Show transformation, not trauma** - focus on growth
4. **Include specific details** - makes story memorable
5. **Connect to broader impact** - individual + collective
6. **Protect privacy** - use first names only unless approved
7. **Avoid before/after narratives** - people aren't projects

**Story Structure:**
- Opening: Where they are now or key insight
- Context: Relevant background (minimal trauma detail)
- Turning point: Discovering Foster Greatness

- Content: Video views, engagement rates, reach

**How to Present Data:**
```
[Statistic] → [Human impact] → [System change]

Example:
"77 wishes granted" → "Professional tools and personal necessities for community members" → "Removing barriers to education and employment stability"
```
