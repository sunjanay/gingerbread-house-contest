## Social Media Content

### Example 1: Instagram Post (Community Impact)

**Image:** Photo from Thanksgiving Cook-Off event (with member permission)

**Caption:**

```
For some of our community members, this year's Virtual Thanksgiving Cook-Off was their first time ever celebrating the holidays.

"I heard from the community that, for some of them, this was their first year ever celebrating the holidays because of foster care. Some shared how they struggle with food insecurity and how the holiday season serves as a stark reminder of just how far the system left them behind. Others shared how this space felt comforting, trusting, and how they couldn't wait for future events just like this." - FG Team Member

This is what community looks like. Not perfect. Not polished. Just real people creating the family gatherings they deserve.

In 2024, we hosted 16 panels and workshops reaching 310 attendees. From healing circles to professional development to holiday celebrations‚Äîevery event is designed by and for people with lived experience in foster care.

Want to join the next gathering? Link in bio or DM us.

#FosterGreatness #CommunityOverCharity #LivedExperience #HolidayBelonging #FosterCare #ChosemFamily
```

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with powerful personal truth
- Uses direct quote for authenticity
- Acknowledges systemic barriers without dwelling
- Celebrates community creation
- Includes impact data
- Clear CTA
- Hashtag strategy balances reach and relevance

### Example 2: LinkedIn Post (Business Model Innovation)

**Caption:**

```
Most nonprofits chase grants. We run a business.

Foster Greatness is powered by DGW Branded‚Äîa promotional products company that generates consistent revenue to fund programs for foster youth.

Here's why this model works:

üîÑ Sustainable: No grant cycles. No funding uncertainty. Reliable revenue = reliable support for our community.

üíº Dignified: Community members aren't "beneficiaries"‚Äîthey're part of a movement powered by business success.

üìà Scalable: As DGW Branded grows, Foster Greatness expands. More revenue = more scholarships, crisis support, and career development.

üéØ Measurable: Every promotional product order directly funds specific programs. Clients see exact impact of their business decisions.

2024 Impact powered by this model:
‚Ä¢ 1,100+ active community members nationwide
‚Ä¢ $39,000+ in Foster Youth Tax Credit returns
‚Ä¢ 77+ wishes granted through crisis support
‚Ä¢ 140 individuals connected to 600,000+ resources

For corporations: Your purchasing decisions already happen. What if they also created transformational impact for foster youth?

For funders: Your investment amplifies business-generated revenue rather than sustaining basic operations.

This is what innovation in the social sector looks like.

### Example 3: Twitter/X Thread (Tax Season Support)

**Tweet 1:**
```
Don't leave $1,117 on the table.

The California Foster Youth Tax Credit exists for current and former foster youth ages 18-25 who earned $1-$30K.

In 2024, we helped 77 members file their taxes and returned $39,000+ to our community.

Your money. Your future. üßµ
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Here's what you need to qualify for the Foster Youth Tax Credit:

‚úÖ Current or former foster youth
‚úÖ Age 18-25 at end of tax year
‚úÖ Earned $1 to $30,000
‚úÖ Filed California taxes

That's it. If you check these boxes, you deserve up to $1,117.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
"I didn't know this existed until Foster Greatness helped me file. That $1,117 covered my car repairs and I could finally get to work reliably." - Community member

This is earned support. Not charity. Money you're already entitled to.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
How we help:

üìã 1:1 tax filing support
üí∞ Maximize your FYTC return
üì± Virtual meetings on your schedule
‚úÖ Free support from start to refund

35 members received their full FYTC with our guidance in 2024.

```

**Why This Works:**

- Final tweet = clear CTA
- Emoji use appropriate for Twitter

## Partnership Proposals

### Example 1: Corporate Partner Pitch (Email Version)

**Subject:** Transform your promotional products into foster youth impact

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

You already purchase promotional products‚Äîbranded merchandise, corporate gifts, event swag. What if those same purchases directly funded scholarships, crisis support, and career development for foster youth nationwide?

That's the DGW Branded difference.

THE PROBLEM:
Traditional corporate giving is disconnected from business operations. Donations feel like add-ons, not integrated impact.

OUR SOLUTION:
DGW Branded is a promotional products company and social enterprise. 100% of profits power Foster Greatness‚Äîa lived experience-led nonprofit supporting 1,100+ current and former foster youth.

When you order through us, you don't write a separate check for impact. Your business purchase IS the impact.

WHAT YOUR COMPANY GETS:
‚úì Same products you already need
‚úì Competitive pricing and quality
‚úì Dedicated account management
‚úì Quarterly impact reports showing exact outcomes
‚úì Authentic CSR story employees and customers care about

2024 IMPACT YOUR PARTNERSHIP COULD FUND:
‚Ä¢ $39,000+ in Foster Youth Tax Credit returns (77 members)
‚Ä¢ 77+ wishes granted for essential items ($15,000+ value)
‚Ä¢ 220 resource requests fulfilled for 140 individuals
‚Ä¢ 310 attendees at 16 community workshops and panels
‚Ä¢ Career development and job placement for foster alumni

YOUR INVESTMENT:
Simply route your existing promotional product orders through DGW Branded. No additional budget required‚Äîjust redirect spending you're already doing.

EXAMPLE:
[Company X] spent $50,000 on branded merchandise in 2024. That same budget through DGW Branded funded:
‚Ä¢ 44 Foster Youth Tax Credit returns
‚Ä¢ Crisis support for 12 community members
‚Ä¢ Career workshops for 50+ participants

### Example 2: Foundation Grant Proposal (Executive Summary)

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: FOSTER GREATNESS EXPANSION 2025

ORGANIZATION:
Foster Greatness is a lived experience-led nonprofit creating lifelong community and belonging for current and former foster youth nationwide. We are powered by DGW Branded, a social enterprise generating sustainable revenue through promotional products sales.

THE PROBLEM:
Foster youth face a belonging gap, not just a resource gap. While 20,000+ young people age out of foster care annually, existing support systems focus on transactional services without addressing the fundamental need for lifelong community. 75% report feeling isolated; 50% experience homelessness within 18 months of aging out.

OUR SOLUTION:
Foster Greatness operates on a revolutionary principle: "Age into but never age out." Through our digital community platform, 1,100+ members access 24/7 peer support, 600,000+ resources, employment pathways, crisis support, and events‚Äîall designed by those with lived experience.

What makes us different:
‚Ä¢ Business-powered sustainability (DGW Branded revenue)

‚Ä¢ Produce 30+ Thriver Stories expanding national awareness

SUSTAINABILITY MODEL:
DGW Branded generates $[X] annually, covering 60% of operational costs. Foundation funding accelerates expansion and allows program innovation while maintaining financial stability. Within 36 months, business revenue will cover 80% of operations.

WHY NOW:
Foster care system urgently needs proven alternatives to traditional support models. Our 2024 impact demonstrates demand and effectiveness. Foundation investment enables nationwide scaling while maintaining quality and community ownership.

EVALUATION:
Rigorous mixed-methods evaluation tracking:
‚Ä¢ Community engagement metrics (utilization, retention)
‚Ä¢ Resource access outcomes (dollars secured, needs met)
‚Ä¢ Employment stability and career advancement
‚Ä¢ Crisis support response and resolution
‚Ä¢ Member-reported belonging and life satisfaction

Thank you for giving us the chance to do better.

- [Name], Resource Team Lead
```

Most support for foster youth ends at 18 or 21. Life doesn't.

That's why Foster Greatness exists.

FOSTER GREATNESS AND STAFFMARK ANNOUNCE EMPLOYMENT PIPELINE PARTNERSHIP
Comprehensive Career Development Program Connects Foster Youth with Meaningful Employment

[CITY, STATE] ‚Äì [Date] ‚Äì Foster Greatness, a lived experience-led nonprofit creating lifelong community for current and former foster youth, announced today a strategic partnership with Staffmark, a leading staffing agency, to launch a comprehensive Employment Pipeline program.

The partnership addresses a critical gap in foster youth support: while many programs focus on job placement, few provide the holistic career development and ongoing workplace support needed for long-term success. The Foster Greatness Employment Pipeline combines skills assessment, professional development, personalized coaching, direct job placement, and retention support.

"Foster youth don't just need jobs‚Äîthey need career pathways and ongoing support to thrive in the workplace," said [Name, Title], Foster Greatness. "This partnership with Staffmark creates exactly that: a comprehensive approach that meets each person where they are and supports them through every stage of career development."

PROGRAM COMPONENTS:
‚Ä¢ Skills assessment and career mapping
‚Ä¢ Resume building and interview preparation
‚Ä¢ Professional development workshops
‚Ä¢ One-on-one career coaching
‚Ä¢ Direct job placement with vetted employers
‚Ä¢ 90-day workplace support and check-ins
‚Ä¢ Career advancement planning

"Staffmark is committed to creating equitable employment opportunities," said [Staffmark Contact]. "Our partnership with Foster Greatness allows us to provide specialized support that recognizes the unique strengths and experiences of foster youth and alumni."

The Employment Pipeline is available at no cost to Foster Greatness community members nationwide. Interested individuals can apply at community.fostergreatness.co/employment.

ABOUT FOSTER GREATNESS:

Through a digital platform connecting 1,100+ members, Foster Greatness provides resource navigation, employment pathways, crisis support, community events, and storytelling opportunities.

## Donor Communications

### Example 1: Year-End Giving Appeal

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: "The best $50 you'll spend this year"
- B: "This is what community can do"
- C: "[Name], 1,100 reasons to give today"

**Email Body:**

```
Dear [Name],

What does $50 buy?

For most nonprofits: Administrative costs. Overhead. Maybe part of a program.

For Foster Greatness: Direct, measurable impact for foster youth. Here's exactly what your gift does:

$50 ‚Üí Tax preparation support for one member (could unlock $1,117 in returns)
$100 ‚Üí Emergency grocery gift cards for a family facing food insecurity
$250 ‚Üí Professional development workshop for 25 participants
$500 ‚Üí One wish granted through our One Simple Wish partnership
$1,000 ‚Üí Full month of 24/7 crisis support capacity

Why your gift multiplies:

Foster Greatness is powered by DGW Branded, a social enterprise that covers 60% of our operational costs through promotional products revenue. That means your donation goes directly to programs, not keeping the lights on.

Your $50 doesn't fund a portion of something. It funds actual, complete support for a real person.

2024 impact your support created:
‚Ä¢ 1,100+ members connected to lifelong community
‚Ä¢ $39,000+ in Foster Youth Tax Credit returns
‚Ä¢ 77+ wishes granted in crisis support
‚Ä¢ 140 individuals served through resource navigation
‚Ä¢ 310 attendees at community-building events

But here's what the numbers don't show:

"I was three days from eviction when Foster Greatness connected me with emergency housing support. Not in three weeks. Not eventually. In three days. That's what saved me." - Community Member

That's the power of immediate, dignity-centered support backed by sustainable business revenue and amplified by donations like yours.

Will you make a gift today?

Questions about where your money goes? Reply to this email‚ÄîI'll personally respond and show you exactly how we deploy every dollar.

Gratefully,
