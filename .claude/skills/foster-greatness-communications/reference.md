### Scenario 3: Media Asks About "Aged Out" Statistics

**Question:** "How many of your members 'aged out' of foster care?"

**Response:**
```
We intentionally don't use the term "aged out" at Foster Greatness because it suggests an ending—when our entire mission is about creating lifelong community that continues.

What we can share:
• 1,100+ members are current or former foster youth
• Our members range from [age range]
• [X%] left foster care without permanent family connections
• [X%] accessed support within first year after leaving care
• Our principle: "Age into but never age out"

Instead of defining people by when they left the system, we focus on what they're building: careers, stability, community, and greatness.

Would you like to interview community members who can speak to their own experiences? We can facilitate with consent and preparation.
```

### Scenario 4: Negative Comment on Social Media

**Scenario:** Comment says "This is just another charity pretending to help"

**Response:**
```
We appreciate you sharing your concern. You're right to be skeptical—there are too many organizations that don't deliver on promises.

What makes Foster Greatness different:
• We're led BY foster youth, not just FOR foster youth
• We're powered by business revenue (DGW Branded), not just grants
• We publish our impact data publicly: [link]
• Every program is shaped by member feedback

We'd welcome the chance to show you exactly how we operate and where resources go. DM us or email [contact] if you'd like to discuss further.
```

### Scenario 5: Donor Asks "Where Does My Money Go?"

**Question:** "If you're funded by DGW Branded, why do you need donations?"

**Response:**
```
Excellent question! Here's the full picture:

DGW BRANDED REVENUE:
• Covers ~60% of operational costs
• Provides sustainable baseline funding
• Allows us to scale as business grows

DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS:
• Go 100% directly to programs
• Fund crisis support, scholarships, emergency needs
• Enable rapid response to urgent situations
• Allow us to serve more members faster

Example: DGW Branded keeps the lights on and staff paid. Your $100 donation becomes an emergency grocery gift card for a member facing food insecurity—deployed within 24 hours.

The business model creates sustainability. Donations create immediate impact and rapid expansion.
